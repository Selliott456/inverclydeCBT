    <h1>Will CBT Work For Me?</h1>
    <p>CBT suits individuals with all sorts of problems
      â€“ including (but not limited to) depression, anxiety, phobias, difficult
      relationships, obsessive-compulsive disorder and eating
      disorders. <br><br></br></br>
      CBT is evidence-based, which means we know it works!
      The approach is individualised and collaborative meaning
      the client feels empowered with regards to their 
      treatment and progress.
